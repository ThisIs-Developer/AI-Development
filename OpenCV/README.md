## Introduction

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, follow these steps:

### Using pip (Python)

```bash
pip install opencv-python requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
    cd opencv
    ```

2. Create a build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Configure the build with CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. Compile and install:
    ```bash
    make -j8
    sudo make install
    ```

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html).

## Features

- Image Processing (filtering, transformations, etc.)
- Video Analysis (object tracking, background subtraction, etc.)
- Feature Detection and Matching
- Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction
- Machine Learning
- Computational Photography
- Object Detection

## Usage

Here are some basic examples of how to use OpenCV in Python:

### Reading and Displaying an Image

```python
import cv2

# Read an image
img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Image', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Converting to Grayscale

```python
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
cv2.imshow('Grayscale Image', gray)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
