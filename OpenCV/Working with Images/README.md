**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source computer vision and image processing library. It provides a wide range of tools and functions that allow developers to work with images and perform various tasks such as image manipulation, analysis, object detection, and more.**
## Installation
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

**Note:** Subtraction Code is also available
```bash
image2 = cv2.resize(image2, (image1.shape[1], image1.shape[0]))
if image1.shape[2] == 1:
    image1 = cv2.cvtColor(image1, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
weightedSum = cv2.addWeighted(image1, 0.5, image2, 0.4, 0)
cv2.imshow('Weighted Image', weightedSum)
if cv2.waitKey(0) & 0xFF == 27:
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
# Convert BGR image to RGB for plotting using matplotlib
weightedSum_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(weightedSum, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
```
