**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source computer vision and image processing library. It provides a wide range of tools and functions that allow developers to work with images and perform various tasks such as image manipulation, analysis, object detection, and more.**
## Installation
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```
