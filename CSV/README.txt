What Is a CSV File?
A CSV file (Comma Separated Values file) is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. Because it’s a plain text file, it can contain only actual text data—in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters.

The structure of a CSV file is given away by its name.

Here’s the employee_birthday.txt file:

name,department,birthday month
John Smith,Accounting,November
Erica Meyers,IT,March
