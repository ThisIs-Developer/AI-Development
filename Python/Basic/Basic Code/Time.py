# Python includes a library of functions for working with time, including a function
# called asctime in the time module. It reads the current time from the com-
# puterâ€™s internal clock and returns it in a human-readable format. Write a program
# that displays the current time and date. Your program will not require any input
from the user.
import time
now = time.asctime()
print(now)
