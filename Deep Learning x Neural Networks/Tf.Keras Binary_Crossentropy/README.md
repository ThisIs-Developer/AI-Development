## binary_crossentropy
Used as a loss function for binary classification model. The binary_crossentropy function computes the cross-entropy loss between true labels and predicted labels.
```bash
  Binary Cross Entropy is the negative average of the log of corrected predicted probabilities.
```
## When fitting a neural network for classification, Keras provide the following three different types of cross entropy loss function:
1. binary_crossentropy
2. categorical_crossentropy
3. sparse_categorical_crossentropy
## Binary Classification
Binary Classification is a problem where we have to segregate our observations in any of the two labels on the basis of the features.
