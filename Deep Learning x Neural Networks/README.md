## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. 
 - Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions. You can use deep learning methods to automate tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as describing images or transcribing a sound file into text.

## Neural Network
Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. 
 - Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.
