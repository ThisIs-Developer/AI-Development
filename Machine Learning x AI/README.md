# Machine learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

## 1. Supervised Learning
In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, to generate expected predictions for the response to new data.
## 2. Unsupervised Learning
In an unsupervised learning model, the algorithm learns on an unlabeled dataset and tries to make sense by extracting features, co-occurrence, and underlying patterns on its own.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns to behave in an environment by performing some actions and analyzing the reactions. RL takes appropriate action in order to maximize the positive response in the particular situation.
