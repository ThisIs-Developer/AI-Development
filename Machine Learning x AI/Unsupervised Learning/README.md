## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.
 - Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.
## Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm:
 - 1.Association
 - 2.Clustering
