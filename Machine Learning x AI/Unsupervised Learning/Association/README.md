## Association Rule Learning
Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable. It tries to find some interesting relations or associations among the variables of dataset. It is based on different rules to discover the interesting relations between variables in the database.

## Association rule learning can be divided into three types of algorithms:
 - Apriori
 - Eclat
 - F-P Growth Algorithm
