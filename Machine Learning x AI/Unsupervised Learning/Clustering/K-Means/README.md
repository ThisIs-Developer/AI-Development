## K-Means Clustering Algorithm
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.

## The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:
 - Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.
 - Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-center, create a cluster.
