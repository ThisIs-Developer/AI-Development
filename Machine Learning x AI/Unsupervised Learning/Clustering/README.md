## Clustering
Clustering in machine learning is the process of grouping similar data points together based on their inherent patterns or similarities. It is an unsupervised learning technique used to discover natural structures or clusters within a dataset, without relying on predefined classes. Clustering helps in organizing and understanding complex datasets by identifying meaningful groups of data points.
