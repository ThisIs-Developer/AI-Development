# [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
**Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc) for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.**

*As such, it offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB. Developers can also use matplotlibâ€™s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications.*
