## Usage

### Running the Project

1. **[Deep Learning Neural Networks (DL-NN)](https://github.com/iam-baivab/AI-Development/tree/main/DL-NN):**
    - This `DL-NN` folder is dedicated to deep learning and neural network projects. It includes code, models, and datasets related to training and deploying deep learning models using frameworks.

2. **[Machine Learning (ML)](https://github.com/iam-baivab/AI-Development/tree/main/ML):**
    - The `ML` folder focuses on traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques. It contains code examples, notebooks, and datasets for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

3. **[OpenCV](https://github.com/iam-baivab/AI-Development/tree/main/OpenCV):**
    - In the `OpenCV` folder, you will find resources for computer vision projects. This includes image and video processing, object detection and tracking, feature extraction, and other computer vision tasks using the OpenCV library.

4. **[Python](https://github.com/iam-baivab/AI-Development/tree/main/Python):**
    - The `Python` folder contains general-purpose Python scripts and utilities that are used across different AI development projects. It includes helper functions, data preprocessing scripts, and other tools to streamline AI development workflows.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Neural Networks (DL-NN):** Implementation and training of various neural network architectures.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Hands-on with regression, classification, clustering, and more.
